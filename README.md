# Recipe-and-Ingredients
This was the topic which we chose as for our mini project. HashMap was used to map the elements, here the key is a type string and value is a ArrayList. 
The basic function of the code is to store the recipe names and it's ingredients. We can call out to see the recipe names and the ingredients.
